# Audio-Phonics-Product-Landing-Page

Responsive Web Design Projects - Building a Product Landing Page. Using HTML and CSS to complete this project.

The goal is to create a responsive product landing page for headphones, modelled after Senheiser Headphones. Since this project is also a part of the 100daysofcode challenge all of the additional notes for it will reside in the 100 days of code repository which I have forked. File to look for > log.md.
